# wxPython GUI Projects

This repository contains a collection of GUI applications built using wxPython. These projects are part of my learning and exploration into desktop application development using Python.

Each application demonstrates the use of wxPython widgets, event handling, and layout management.

## Features

- Basic window creation using `wx.Frame`
- Layouts using `wx.BoxSizer`
- Widgets: `StaticText`, `TextCtrl`, `Button`, `CheckBox`, `ComboBox`
- Event handling with `Bind`
- Progress dialog using `wx.ProgressDialog`
- Object-oriented structure for reusable design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- wxPython

To install wxPython:

```bash
pip install wxPython
```

Running the application
```bash
python app.py
python advanced.py
```
